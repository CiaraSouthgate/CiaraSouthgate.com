        <p>I'm a student in my second term of Computer Systems Technology at BCIT. I chose to study programming because I love learning, problem solving, and thinking creatively. A constantly evolving field like software is a great fit for me.</p>
        <p>I've previously studied music and psychology. Most of my work experience is in customer service and retail, including retail management.</p>
        <p>I'm passionate about dogs, board games, good food, and feminism.</p>

              <p><b><i>MedManager</i></b> is a web app designed to help people keep track of their medications. I worked with two classmates to create it as part of a term one Projects course.</p>
              <p>Users can enter and edit their medications and view them broken down by time of day. Medications that are overdue or upcoming will display an icon to alert the user.</p>
              <p>Users' medications are stored in a Firebase database. The page is populated by programatically creating elements to display each medication at the appropriate times.</p>
              <p>While all elements of the project were collaborative, I was primarily responsible for styling, populating the page, and controlling the alert icons.</p>

              <p>I'm a big fan of board and card games, and Wizard is one that I quite enjoy...as long as someone else does the scoring. I figured there had to be an app to score the game, but none of the available offerings were quite what I wanted. The only solution? Build my own.</p>
              <p>I created a text-only version in Java to make sure I had the logic down, then started learning Android Studio to create the app. Learning as I went along created some challenges and I had to adjust my plan from what I had originally envisioned, but I managed to create something that I'm happy with and excited to use.</p>
              <p>Future plans for the app include allowing users to toggle certain house rules to suit their play style.</p>

              <p>StudyBreak was created in less than 27 hours by myself and four other students during the 2019 BCIT Co-op Hackathon. It's designed to help students maintain healthy habits while studying by reminding them to take breaks for things like water and stretching.</p>
              <p>This project was an adventure for us. We knew our concept wouldn't work without notifications, but the only technology we were all familiar with (web) didn't allow for the kind of notifications we needed. We decided to take a big risk and make it in Android Studio, despite only one of us having any experience with it.</p>
              <p>Our risk paid off, and we won runner-up for the hackathon.</p>
